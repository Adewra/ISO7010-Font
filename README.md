ISO7010-Font
============

A font containg all symbols that are part of the ISO 7010:2011 standard.

I am aware that ISO 7010 has been superceeded by EN 7010. In the future, I plan to address this update, or if somebody wishes to address this themselves, pull requests are always welcome.

Symbol | Title | Description | Unicode
--- | --- | --- | ---
